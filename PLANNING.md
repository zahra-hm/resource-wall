RULES:

  Warnings & Tips
- Do not edit the layout.css file directly, it is auto-generated by layout.scss
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with users.js and widgets.js
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See db folder for pre-populated examples.
- Use the npm run db:reset command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.
    - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database.
    - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to DROP the tables and recreate them.
